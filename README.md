# Heisenbot
Heisenbot is a friendly chatbot I made for the Code2College Elite101 Pre-class project.

## Usage
Run this command to start the chatbot:
`python main.py`

## Description

Since he doesn't use any AI or Machine Learning algorithms, his scope of diologue is very simple. Howver, he can make basic conversation.
Heisenbot's main strength is in answering questions. He can answer most questions about himself and can recognize a question by its wording.

Instead of giving a random response for a statement like most basic chatbots, Heisenbot runs a hash function on user input to decide what to say. 
This way, his response is always the same for any message he is sent.
